# A/B Testing
### What is A/B Testing
A method or a test that helps to analyze the results of two marketing strategies to make the best choice for future marketing campaigns. 
Let's understand with an example:
When I first started an Instagram ad campaign to promote an Instagram post, my target audience was different from the target audience of my second ad campaign. After analysing the outcomes of both ad campaigns, I always preferred the second ad campaign's audience because it provided more reach and followers than the first.

This is what A/B testing entails. Your goal may be to increase sales, followers, or traffic, but choosing the optimal marketing approach based on the results of prior marketing campaigns is nothing more than A/B testing.

For the task of A/B testing using Python, we need to have a dataset about two different marketing strategies for the same goal. I found a dataset that will help us perform A/B testing. 
The dataset we are using here contains two data files about two marketing campaigns (Control Campaign and Test Campaign. 
### Conclusion
Using the A/B test above, we found that the control campaign increased sales and increased engagement from visitors. More products were viewed from control campaigns, resulting in more products in carts and more sales. However, conversion rates for items in the shopping cart are higher in test campaigns. The test campaign generated more sales depending on which products were viewed and added to the shopping cart. And control actions lead to an overall increase in sales. Therefore, a test campaign can be used to market a specific product to a specific audience, and a control campaign can be used to market multiple products to a wider audience.Â
